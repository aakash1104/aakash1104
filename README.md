## Hi There! :wave: :smile: ##

I'm currently a graduate student at [UC Davis](https://cs.ucdavis.edu). I also
got my bachelor's degree here! I love all things tech and love writing code.
Programming helps me narrate stories to a computer so as to create a useable art
for everybody else to use :computer:

I'm always looking for new opportunities to evolve my skill set. Previously, I
was a Software Engineering Intern at [LendingClub](https://www.lendingclub.com)
in San Francisco where I had the great fortune to have worked alongside with 
some amazing (and happy) people!

The _intersection_ of mathematics and computer science also fascinates me:
especially **solving sudoku puzzles** (do people even do this anymore?) because
of its interesting 
[difficulty](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematics_of_Sudoku) and 
[applications](https://www.quora.com/What-are-some-real-world-applications-of-Sudoku)
in computer science!

I'm always looking for my next opportunity! Feel free to reach out to me at 
`aakprabhu [at] ucdavis [dot] edu` if you have questions or just want to chat!
